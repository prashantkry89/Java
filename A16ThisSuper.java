! super
    ðŸŽ€ In Java every constructor has method called super() in default 
    ðŸŽ€ If we had 2 constructor A in class A and B in class B & A is extended by B 
            then after creating obj B of class B both A and B constructor will be called 
    ðŸŽ€ But of we use parameterized constructor then & after passing args in obj B 
            It will call only parameterized constructor B not constructor B or A or 
            parameterized constructor A 
            Dry Run 
            When obj B(args) is created then parameterized constructor B is called
                & as super() is 1st statement in every constructor then it will call
                constructor A after finishing it, it will come back to constructor B
                and executes its code 
            But if still need to call parameterized constructor then in constructor B
                in method super(args) had to be passed then it will call parameterized
                constructor A
            Also if need to print default constructor B then parameterized 
                constructor A then after creating B obj() of constructor B then 
                calling constructor B & in method super(args) pass args it will call
                parameterized constructor A.

            But if need o/p of constructor B parameterized constructor B & 
                constructor A then use of 
                ! this 
                keyword come in form as it will executes constructor of same class


    ðŸŽ€ 1st class in Java in default extends Obj
