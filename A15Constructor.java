! Constructor
    ðŸŽ€ When object is created & get stored in heap memory, It have value 0 in int &
            null in string so if need of value to initialized at time of obj 
            creation then use of Constructor come 
    ðŸŽ€ Constructor is same as method & but it won't return any data like int float 
            String
    ðŸŽ€ It's name must be same as class name 
    
    ðŸŽ€ Every time obj is created constructor is Called 
    ðŸŽ€ When constructor is used then value can be set directly in constructor 
            instead of main fn & obj will get it as constructor is called when obj 
            is created 
    ðŸŽ€ When constructor is not provided then java create virtually its own default constructor 
    ðŸŽ€
